# ML_Income
Welcome to the Income Prediction repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive Python project harnessing the power of machine learning to forecast income levels.

Using a robust combination of pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries, this project dives into a diverse dataset containing demographic and socio-economic attributes such as age, education, occupation, and more.

Through meticulous preprocessing and visualization techniques, key insights are unearthed, paving the way for the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier model. The model is fine-tuned to perfection, ensuring optimal performance in predicting income levels.
